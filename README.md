# Friend Finder

_Friend Finder_ is a full-stack site that takes in the results of users' surveys and compares their answers to other users in order to search for a friend with similar sentiments.

It was created using Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, Express.js and the Bootstrap CSS framework.  And, it's deployed on Heroku.
